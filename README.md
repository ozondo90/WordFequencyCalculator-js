We are going to create a system capable of calculating the
frequency of words in a string. The objective is initially
to obtain an object that will have the word as a property
and the number of occurrences as its value ({hello: 3, house: 2}).
For this exercise, we will clean the string by removing characters
that are not words (, ? : ...). To achieve this, you will need the
replaceAll function. You will also need to convert the sentence to
lowercase using toLowerCase.
